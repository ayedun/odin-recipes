        <ol>
            <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a whlie for a large pot of water to come to a boli (this wlli be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps whlie the water is heating.</li>

            <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape  the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</li>
